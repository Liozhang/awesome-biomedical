## Purpose
Provide available bioinformatics databases, covering most model organisms and hot research areas (RNA, DNA, Protein, Drug). Researchers can use the provided databases for preliminary research and comparison with peer data.

## Latest Update
latest update: 2022-12

## Instructions
`All.Bookmarks.2023-02-21.html` is a collection of 3922 available databases or comprehensive websites, which have been preliminarily grouped and can be imported into `Edge` or other browsers as bookmarks. Importing too many bookmarks at once may temporarily freeze the browser, please be patient.

1. Antibiotic: Antibiotics and resistance
2. Blood: Blood diseases
3. Brain: Neuroscience
4. Cancer: Cancer research
5. CRISPR: CRISPR gene editing
6. Dictionary: Explanation of field keywords, professional terms, and terminology
7. Drug: Drugs and clinical trials
8. Ecoli: E. coli databases
9. Encyclopedia: Professional field encyclopedias
10. Enzyme: Enzyme-related
11. Epigenomic: Epigenetics
12. Eye: Ophthalmology
13. GeneSet: Specific gene sets
14. Genomic: Genomics
15. Immunity: Immunity and infection
16. Metabolomic: Metabolomics
17. Metagenome: Metagenomics

Each HTML file can be imported into the browser as bookmarks. The bookmark path is: Favorites bar -> Research Tools -> Relevant Subset Name.

## Bookmark Title Format

### Main format of bookmark titles:

`{Website Name} || {Website Description} | {Top Five Keywords}`

Example:

`MarkerDB || Biomarker Database | DNA | RNA | Protein | Structure | Pathway`

### Website Name: 

Can be the full name or abbreviation of the database or website.

Example: `MarkerDB`

### Website Description:

A brief introduction to the website, obtained manually or from the webpage title, translated into Chinese or only in English. Some websites that are difficult to distinguish may not have a description.

Example: `Biomarker Database`

### Top Five Keywords:

Obtained from the given webpage. If the website is for data analysis or the webpage has little text, it may not be possible to obtain the keywords correctly.

Example: `DNA | RNA | Protein | Structure | Pathway`

## Usage in Edge Browser

After importing into the browser, you can directly search for related tags in the Edge browser's address bar by typing part of the bookmark title keywords, such as:

Type "ngdc"

If there is no prompt, you can enable it by the following operation:
